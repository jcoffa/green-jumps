# Green Jumps

A Puzzle Platformer made in Godot v4.6 for a friendly Game Jam with some friends.

The jam went from **Friday January 16th 2026 at 6pm** until **Sunday February 8th 2026 at 12pm noon**.
This was intentionally quite long because none of my friends and I are in the games industry,
none of us have any real game-making experience, and we all have full-time jobs and social lives
and didn't really want to put our life on pause to grind out a game in a very short time (as is
traditional for game jams). This is all just for fun and education!
